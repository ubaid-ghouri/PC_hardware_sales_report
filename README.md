Atilq Hardware, a supplier of computer hardware and peripherals to clients across India, is experiencing challenges in effectively tracking sales performance amid dynamic growth in the management structure. The Sales Director has identified a need for a more streamlined and efficient way to monitor sales metrics and trends. To address this issue, we have developed a Power BI dashboard that incorporates the following steps: 

1. Data Discovery: Identifying and understanding relevant sales data sources.
2. Data Cleaning: Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of the data.
3. Data Merging: Integrating data from various sources to create a comprehensive view.
4. Generating Dashboards in Power BI: Visualizing key sales metrics to facilitate informed decision-making.

This project aims to empower the Sales Director and management team with real-time insights, enabling them to make data-driven decisions and respond swiftly to the evolving sales landscape.
